# Rule-Based Chatbot Project

## Introduction
This project is a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. It utilizes pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This chatbot serves as an introductory project to understand the basics of natural language processing (NLP) and conversation flow in software applications.

## Features
- **Pattern Matching**: Identifies user input patterns to trigger responses.
- **Predefined Responses**: Offers a set of predetermined responses for recognized patterns.
- **Simple NLP**: Implements basic natural language processing techniques.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new rules and responses.

## How It Works
The chatbot operates by analyzing user inputs and matching them against a set of predefined rules. If a match is found, the chatbot provides the corresponding response. The process is as follows:
1. **Receive Input**: The chatbot takes user input in the form of text.
2. **Pattern Identification**: It uses pattern matching to identify the intent of the user's message.
3. **Response Generation**: Based on the identified pattern, the chatbot selects an appropriate response from its rule set.
4. **Output**: The selected response is then displayed to the user.
